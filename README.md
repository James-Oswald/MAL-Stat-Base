# MAL-Stat-Viewer
Simple C++ program that uses the standard library and boost libraries to play around with Anime List data from MyAnimeLists anime list XML data export. This project essentially just defines a class for anime data, then reads and processes the list xml file using boost, stores the data for each anime in an object and puts all said Anime objects into a standard vector. 

I started this project off with the intent to build a GUI and add some statistical calculations for the list data, however after much deliberation I decided that my GUI options in C++ were too limited and decided to move over to a web application using JS. 

Hence this project has been superseded by my new AniGraph application at
